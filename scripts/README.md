# Scripts

Utility scripts for this monorepo.

## QA Pipeline

### `run-qa.mjs`

Runs the full QA pipeline sequentially: install (skipped when `node_modules` exists), checktypes, lint, `openapi:drift`, `openapi:lint`, `sherif`, build, `test:scripts`, test, test:e2e (`SKIP_BUILD=1`). Stops immediately on the first failure and prints a clear error banner. `knip` is not a phase; `lint.yml` runs it on every PR.

**Usage**: Via pnpm at repository root:

```bash
pnpm qa
# or
node scripts/run-qa.mjs
```

## Local development

### `dev.mjs`

Root `pnpm dev` entry. Starts the Portless HTTPS proxy on port 443 when it is down (one sudo prompt in this process, before Turbo), then local Postgres (`pnpm --filter @repo/db db:start`) unless `SKIP_DB_START=1`, prints Portless `https://*.localhost` URLs (worktree-aware via `portless get`), then Turbo TUI with `SKIP_DB_START=1` so the eve `db:start` wait is a no-op. Schema and identity seed run on API boot. Skips the proxy when `CI=1` or `PORTLESS=0`.

```bash
pnpm dev
SKIP_DB_START=1 pnpm dev
```

## Setup

### `setup-skills.mjs`

Reads [`skills-lock-manifest.mjs`](skills-lock-manifest.mjs), runs `pnpm dlx skills@latest add <source> --skill <name> … -y --agent cursor` per catalog, and removes `.claude/` and `.cursor/skills/` if present. The skills CLI updates [`skills-lock.json`](../skills-lock.json). Used by `pnpm setup` and CI `setup-pnpm`.

```bash
pnpm setup:skills
```

## Dependencies

### `update-deps.mjs`

Updates pnpm via Corepack (`corepack use pnpm@latest`; Corepack owns the install, so `pnpm self-update` fails), syncs `packageManager` in nested package.json files, then runs `pnpm update --latest --recursive` plus `.deepsec`.

```bash
pnpm update-deps
```

### Monorepo hygiene

- **`pnpm knip`** — unused files (`knip.json`). Every PR via `lint.yml`. Not part of `pnpm qa`.
- **`pnpm sherif`** — workspace dependency version alignment. `pnpm qa` and `lint.yml`.
- **`pnpm openapi:drift`** — regenerate OpenAPI and clients, fail on git drift and untracked `gen/` files. `pnpm qa` and `lint.yml`.
- **`pnpm openapi:lint`** — Redocly lint on `apps/api/openapi/openapi.json` (`.redocly.yaml`). `pnpm qa` and `lint.yml`.
- **`pnpm agentic:scan`** — `is-agentic` against `AGENTIC_SCAN_URL`. Operator only. Not `pnpm qa` and not CI.
- **`pnpm db:studio`** — Drizzle Studio. Local only. Needs `pnpm db:start` and `POSTGRES_URL`.

### `check-openapi-drift.mjs`

Used by `pnpm openapi:drift` and `lint.yml`. Boots codegen with a JWT placeholder when `JWT_SECRET` is unset.

### `agentic-scan.mjs`

Wraps pinned `is-agentic`. Default host comes from `AGENTIC_SCAN_URL` (optional `https://` prefix stripped to hostname).

### `vercel-install.mjs`

Vercel pnpm 12 runner: `npm install -g` the `packageManager` pin with scripts, then invoke that binary (never Vercel’s PATH shim). Isolates `PNPM_HOME` and disables package-manager version switching. `installCommand` / `buildCommand` / `devCommand` in `apps/*/vercel.json`. Pin equality lives in `vercel-pnpm.mjs` (`pnpm test:scripts`).

## Security Scripts

Scripts that prevent committing secrets, scan for vulnerabilities, and install security tools.

### Security Script Organization

All security-related pnpm scripts are organized under the `security:` namespace:

- **`pnpm security:block-files`** - Check for blocked secret file types
- **`pnpm security:secrets`** - Scan staged files for secrets (gitleaks)
- **`pnpm security:secrets:full`** - Full repository secret scan (gitleaks)
- **`pnpm security:osv`** - Scan dependencies for vulnerabilities (OSV Scanner)
- **`pnpm security:audit`** - Run pnpm audit for high+ vulnerabilities (`--ignore-registry-errors` so npm registry timeouts/HTTP errors do not fail the check)
- **`pnpm security:check`** - Run all security checks (comprehensive)
- **`pnpm security:deepsec:scan`** - DeepSec regex scan (no AI)
- **`pnpm security:deepsec:process:diff`** - DeepSec AI review vs `origin/main` (GPT-5.6 Sol / Codex)
- **`pnpm security:deepsec:process:diff:grok`** - Same diff review with Cursor Grok 4.6 / Pi
- **`pnpm security:deepsec:process`** - DeepSec full-repo AI review (GPT-5.6 Sol / Codex)
- **`pnpm security:deepsec:report`** - DeepSec findings summary

DeepSec lives in `.deepsec/` and is not part of pre-commit or `security.yml`. `scan` is free. `process` needs `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`. See [Security](https://basilic-docs.vercel.app/docs/architecture/security).

### `block-secret-files.mjs`

Prevents committing sensitive file types in pre-commit hooks.

**What gets blocked**:

- `.env` and related sensitive paths (see `block-secret-files.mjs`); allowed committed templates — `.env.<qualifier>.example`, `.env.schema`, `.env.{development,staging,production,test}` — use the same patterns in `.trufflehogignore` for TruffleHog
- `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.p12`, `*.pfx`, `*.jks`, `*.keystore`
- `id_rsa*` (SSH private keys)
- Certificate files: `*.crt`, `*.cer`, `*.der`, `*.p7b`, `*.p7c`, `*.p7m`, `*.p7s`
- `*.keytab`

**Usage**: Automatically runs in pre-commit hooks via `simple-git-hooks`.

### `scan-secrets-staged.mjs`

Wrapper script for gitleaks staged file scanning.

**What it scans**:

- Cryptocurrency private keys (Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos, etc.)
- Mnemonic phrases and seed phrases
- API keys and secrets
- JWT secrets
- Database passwords
- AWS credentials

**Usage**: Automatically runs in pre-commit hooks. Can be run manually:

```bash
pnpm security:secrets
```

If gitleaks is missing, the script skips and prints `pnpm setup:gitleaks`.

### `scan-osv.mjs`

Wrapper script for OSV Scanner vulnerability scanning.

**What it scans**:

- Dependencies in `pnpm-lock.yaml` for known vulnerabilities
- Checks against OSV (Open Source Vulnerabilities) database

**Usage**: Automatically runs in pre-commit hooks via `hooks:security`. Can be run manually:

```bash
pnpm security:osv
# or
node scripts/scan-osv.mjs
```

**Note**: Requires osv-scanner to be installed. If not installed, the script will skip gracefully with a warning.

### `setup-gitleaks.mjs`

Installs gitleaks for secret scanning in git repositories.

**What it installs**:

- **gitleaks** (required): Secret scanning tool that detects hardcoded secrets, API keys, passwords, and other sensitive information

**Installation methods**:

- **macOS / Linux**: Downloads gitleaks **8.30.1** from GitHub releases (`gitleaksVersion` in the script) and verifies a pinned SHA-256 before extract/install
- **Windows**: Prints installation instructions (Chocolatey, Scoop, or manual)

**Usage**: Automatically runs during `pnpm setup`. Can be run manually:

```bash
pnpm setup:gitleaks
# or
node scripts/setup-gitleaks.mjs
```

**Note**: gitleaks is required. Pre-commit hooks will fail if gitleaks is not installed.

### `setup-osv-scanner.mjs`

Installs osv-scanner for vulnerability scanning in dependencies.

**What it installs**:

- **osv-scanner** (optional): Vulnerability scanner that checks dependencies against OSV database

**Installation methods**:

- **macOS / Linux**: Downloads osv-scanner **2.6.0** from GitHub releases (`osvScannerVersion` in the script; same tag as CI)
- **Windows**: Prints installation instructions (Chocolatey, Scoop, or manual)

**Usage**: Automatically runs during `pnpm setup`. Can be run manually:

```bash
pnpm setup:osv
# or
node scripts/setup-osv-scanner.mjs
```

**Note**: osv-scanner is optional. Used for scanning dependencies with `pnpm security:osv`.

### `setup:deepsec` (package.json)

Installs the DeepSec workspace in `.deepsec/` (same as CI `deepsec.yml`).

**What it installs**:

- **deepsec** and transitive deps from `.deepsec/pnpm-lock.yaml`

**Usage**: Automatically runs during `pnpm setup`. Can be run manually:

```bash
pnpm setup:deepsec
```

**Note**: Required for `pnpm security:deepsec:*` commands. `process` still needs `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`.

### `setup:playwright` (package.json)

Installs Playwright Chromium for `@repo/api` and `@repo/web` E2E tests. Default browser cache when `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` is unset: Linux `~/.cache/ms-playwright`, macOS `~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright`, Windows `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\ms-playwright`.

**Usage**: Automatically runs during `pnpm setup`. Can be run manually:

```bash
pnpm setup:playwright
```

### `security-check.mjs`

Comprehensive security check script that runs all security scans.

**What it checks**:

1. Blocked secret files (via `block-secret-files.mjs`)
2. Secrets in repository (via gitleaks)
3. Dependency vulnerabilities (via osv-scanner)
4. pnpm audit for high+ severity vulnerabilities (`pnpm security:audit`; registry errors ignored)

**Usage**: Run manually to perform all security checks:

```bash
pnpm security:check
# or
node scripts/security-check.mjs
```

**Note**: Scripts will skip gracefully if tools are not installed, but will report warnings.

## Environment Scripts

### `setup-env.mjs`

Copies `.env.<qualifier>.example` templates to gitignored dest files when the dest is missing. Never overwrites existing dest files.

**Mapping**:

- `.env.defaults.example` → `.env`
- `.env.local.example` → `.env.local`
- `.env.test.example` → `.env.test`
- any other `.env.<qualifier>.example` → `.env.<qualifier>`

**Usage**: Automatically runs during `pnpm setup`. Can be run manually:

```bash
pnpm setup:env
# or
node scripts/setup-env.mjs
```

**Note**: Idempotent. Skips dest files that already exist so local secrets are preserved. Edit copied files to set real values.

### `setup-portless.mjs`

Trusts the Portless local CA and starts the HTTPS proxy on port 443. Skips when `CI=1`. May prompt for OS confirmation or sudo. Re-run is safe. Daily `pnpm dev` does not repeat CA trust, but may restart the proxy when it is unavailable.

```bash
pnpm setup:portless
# or
node scripts/setup-portless.mjs
```

**Note**: Existing `.env` dest files are not rewritten. Update app URLs to `https://*.tracker.localhost` if they still use `localhost:<port>`. Eve catalog URLs are `https://agents.tracker.localhost/eve/command` and `/eve/chat`.

## Database Development Scripts

Scripts that install database development tools for PostgreSQL with Supabase.

### `setup-database.mjs`

Installs Docker, Docker Compose, and Supabase CLI for local PostgreSQL development and database management.

**What it installs**:

- **Docker** (required): Container runtime required by Supabase CLI for local development
- **Docker Compose** (required): Included with Docker, used by Supabase CLI for orchestrating services
- **Supabase CLI** (optional): Command-line tool for local PostgreSQL development, migrations, and Supabase project management

**Installation methods**:

- **macOS**:
  - Docker: Installs Docker Desktop via Homebrew (`brew install --cask docker`)
  - Docker Compose: Included with Docker Desktop
  - Supabase CLI: Uses Homebrew if available (`brew install supabase/tap/supabase`)
- **Linux**:
  - Docker: Installs Docker Engine via official Docker repository (Debian/Ubuntu)
  - Docker Compose: Included as plugin with Docker Engine
  - Supabase CLI: Downloads pinned `.deb` **2.117.0** (`supabaseVersion` in the script) and installs with `dpkg`
- **Windows**: Prints installation instructions (Chocolatey, Scoop, or manual)

**Usage**: Can be run manually:

```bash
pnpm setup:database
# or
node scripts/setup-database.mjs
```

**Note**: Docker and Docker Compose are required for Supabase CLI to function. Supabase CLI is optional. Used for local PostgreSQL development with Supabase. Database features will skip if Supabase CLI is not available.

After Supabase is running, daily start is **`pnpm db:start`** then **`pnpm dev`** (migrate + seed on API boot). A full wipe is **`pnpm reset`**. See `apps/api/README.md`.

## Notes

- Publishing scripts use `process.cwd()` to find the package's `package.json` (they run from within each package directory)
- If `.package-originals.json` doesn't exist, `restore-publish.mjs` exits gracefully (useful for first-time runs)
- Publishing scripts are only needed for packages that will be published to npm
- Private workspace-only packages don't need publishing scripts
- Security scripts run from the repository root and work with the monorepo structure

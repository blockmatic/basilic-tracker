# Async utils (`@repo/utils/async`)

Helpers for delayed execution and time-bounded fetch. No peer dependencies.

## API

### `delay(ms)`

Resolves after the given milliseconds.

```ts
import { delay } from "@repo/utils/async";

await delay(1000); // 1 second
```

### `fetchWithTimeout({ url, options?, timeoutMs? })`

Fetches with a timeout via `AbortController`. Default `timeoutMs` is 5000.

```ts
import { fetchWithTimeout } from "@repo/utils/async";

const res = await fetchWithTimeout({
  url: "https://api.example.com/data",
  options: { headers: { Authorization: "Bearer token" } },
  timeoutMs: 10_000,
});
```

Use this for external calls instead of raw `fetch` to avoid unbounded waits.

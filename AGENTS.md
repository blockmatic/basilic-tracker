# Coin Tracker

Agents working in this directory are working on Coin Tracker, a Basilic app that diverged from the starter. Read `PRODUCT.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `README.md` first. Upstream guides: https://basilic-docs.vercel.app. Project docs win when they disagree with Doku. Wallet, markets, and on-chain code stay in this repository. There is no mobile app and no Doku app here.

This workspace has one shared agent contract: this file plus `.agents/skills/` (lock-installed stack skills and Basilic `/w-*` playbooks). Cursor slash, glob `.mdc` attach, and `.cursor/mcp.json` are adapters. Other harnesses load the same contract through this file and open `SKILL.md` when there is no `/` menu. Do not create a second workflow or a competing source of truth.

These instructions apply to the whole monorepo. A nested `AGENTS.md` adds or overrides guidance for its subtree and must be read before changing files there.

## Start here

1. Always-on constraints are **this file**. Do not chase `.cursor/rules` for the global contract.
2. When editing files that match a glob in [File-scoped rules](#file-scoped-rules), read that `.cursor/rules` file (Cursor auto-attaches it).
3. Read `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` when the user invokes a skill or the task matches (after `pnpm setup` / `pnpm skills:install`, which restores catalogs from `skills-lock.json`). Daily path: Basilic `/w-*` under `.agents/skills/workflow/w-<name>/` (`/w-plan`, `/w-grill`, `/w-wayfinder`, `/w-build`, `/w-ship`). If the harness has no `/` menu, open the `SKILL.md` file. Catalog: [`blockmatic/basilic-skills`](https://github.com/blockmatic/basilic-skills).
4. Read `PRODUCT.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `README.md` before changing product behavior. Upstream technical docs: https://basilic-docs.vercel.app.
5. Read the target app or package `README.md` and `package.json` before choosing setup, generation, validation, or test commands.

Local HTTP apps use Portless named HTTPS hosts. Do not discover bind ports.

- Web: `https://tracker.localhost`
- API: `https://api.tracker.localhost`
- Docs: https://basilic-docs.vercel.app (this app has no Doku host)
- Email preview: `https://email.tracker.localhost`
- Eve: `https://agents.tracker.localhost` (`/eve/command`, `/eve/chat`)

Linked git worktrees prefix the branch (`https://fix-ui.api.tracker.localhost`). Escape hatch: `pnpm --filter <pkg> dev:app` or `PORTLESS=0`. Postgres stays on `127.0.0.1:54322`. Playwright/CI spawn `localhost:3000` / `:3001` (no Portless; eve is not in the Playwright DAG).

Search first and keep reads targeted. Inspect the implementation, configuration, and tests instead of relying on memory or assuming that documentation is current.

## Always-on contract

### Behavior

- Docs: `PRODUCT.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `README.md` in this workspace. Upstream guides: https://basilic-docs.vercel.app. Daily path: Basilic `/w-*` (`/w-plan`, `/w-grill`, `/w-wayfinder`, `/w-build`, `/w-commit` … `/w-ship`). `/w-build` does not commit. Publish with `/w-ship`.
- After features/fixes: same change, update that MDX and nearest README if behavior, commands, or conventions changed; glob `.mdc` only if a Cursor-scoped constraint changed.
- When creating plans add a ## References section listing rules, skills, and MDX pages used.
- Summarize assumptions in 3–5 bullets.
- Respect read-only / review requests (do not edit unless the user also asked).
- Verify before destructive operations.
- Defer to the user for ambiguous, high-risk decisions.
- Never ask before modifying files (including dotfiles).
- Provide concise summaries when finishing.
- Search first (Grep/Glob), read later. Targeted reads over broad exploration.
- Maximize parallel calls (batch file reads/searches). Spawn 2–3 read-only explorers for independent angles (`/w-council`); git and publish stay single-writer.

### Workflow

- Plan first for non-trivial tasks (3+ steps, architectural decisions); re-plan if stuck. `/w-plan` explores via `/w-council` first. `/w-grill` stress-tests a plan. `/w-wayfinder` charts fog bigger than one session. Keep a focused task list for multi-step work.
- On user correction: acknowledge the mistake and adjust (avoid repeating it).
- Don't mark complete without proving it works (run tests, check logs, diff behavior).
- For non-trivial changes: pause for a simpler approach; avoid hacky fixes.
- Bug reports: fix autonomously—use logs, errors, failing tests; fix CI without being told.

### Code quality

- Simplicity first, minimal impact—change only what is necessary.
- Find the root cause; no temporary fixes.
- Collocate related functionality.
- ALWAYS follow linting rules: Ultracite (Oxlint + Oxfmt).
- Search for existing functionality before creating new.
- Always use existing packages in the codebase before writing custom code.
- Never use console; use `@repo/utils/logger/server` or `@repo/utils/logger/client`.
- Use `@repo/error` for error handling.
- Use `t3-oss` packages for environment variable validation.
- Prefer app `lib/env.ts` values with defaults over global constants; never use global constants (e.g. `constants.ts` or scattered `export const X = ...`). Put config values in `lib/env.ts` as env vars with defaults or exported constants collocated there.
- Use `lodash-es` (per-function imports).

### Naming

- No UPPER_SNAKE_CASE constants—use camelCase for all variables and const declarations.
- Uppercase allowed only for env var keys (e.g. `env.POSTGRES_URL`, `process.env.NODE_ENV`).
- Prefer collocation: keep data in the same file as its consumer; avoid separate `*-titles.ts`, `*-constants.ts` files.
- Use `const titles = {}` in the same file, not `const PAGE_TITLES` in a separate file.

### File organization

- Group 2+ related implementation files in a kebab-case folder; `index.ts` is the public API (named re-exports in apps, not `export *` mega-barrels).
- Single-file modules stay files; colocate tests (`*.test.ts`, `*.spec.ts`) beside implementation.
- Drop the folder-name prefix inside the folder (`oauth-google.ts` → `oauth/google.ts`). Import the group from outside (`.../lib/oauth/index.js`); import siblings directly inside the folder.
- Never add a parent mega-barrel (`lib/index.ts`, `components/ui/index.ts`). Never `foo/foo.ts` plus a thin re-export index. Never `foo.ts` beside `foo/` (basename collision).
- Same runtime for all exports → folder with unifying `index.ts`. Mixed runtimes (server/client) → folder with named entry files and no unifying index.
- Exceptions: Fastify autoload `routes/` and `plugins/` (no `index.ts` there); shadcn `@repo/ui/components/*`; generated `packages/core/src/gen`; Drizzle `packages/db/src/schema/index.ts`; package subpath indexes that are the implementation (`packages/utils/src/data/index.ts`); named entries that would cycle (`catalogs/mapper.ts`).
- Decision tree: https://basilic-docs.vercel.app/docs/development/file-organization.

### Git

- Use default global git user (`git config --global user.name`, `git config --global user.email`)—never cursor/system identity.
- Never `--no-verify` or `--trailer` (e.g. Co-authored-by).
- Fix lint, type-check, and test failures before committing.
- Conventional Commits: `<type>(<scope>): <short summary>` — type/scope lowercase, summary imperative, ≤60 chars, no period. Scope: app (`next`, `fastify`), package (`ui`, `core`, `utils`, `markets`, `onchain`), or omit.
- Branch/validate/commit/push/PR: read `.agents/skills/w-ship/SKILL.md`. Commit message: `.agents/skills/w-commit/SKILL.md`. Slash names `/w-ship`, `/w-push`, `/w-commit`, and `/w-pr` are Cursor extras.

### GitHub Actions

- Inspect PR checks, workflow runs, logs, artifacts, and reruns with **`gh`** (authenticated for the repo remote).
- Common commands: `gh pr checks`, `gh run list --branch "$(git branch --show-current)"`, `gh run view <id> --log-failed`, `gh run watch <id>`, `gh run download <id>`.
- Never use GitHub MCP for Actions — logs, artifacts, and reruns belong to the CLI.
- `/w-gha` and `/w-pr-loop` follow this rule. Waiting on checks belongs to `/w-pr-loop`; do not add `gh run watch` to `/w-push` or `/w-ship`.

## File-scoped rules

Cursor attaches these by glob. Other harnesses should read the matching file when those paths are in scope.

| When editing | Read |
| --- | --- |
| `**/*.{ts,tsx}` | `.cursor/rules/base/typescript.mdc` |
| `**/README.md` | `.cursor/rules/base/readme.mdc` |
| `**/.env.*.example` | `.cursor/rules/base/env-files.mdc` |
| `apps/web/**/*.{tsx,css}` | `.cursor/rules/frontend/nextjs.mdc`, `design.mdc`, `mobile-first.mdc` |
| `**/*.{tsx,css}` | `.cursor/rules/frontend/react.mdc`, `react-hooks.mdc` |
| `apps/web/**/*`, `packages/ui/**/*`, `packages/react/**/*` | `.cursor/rules/frontend/stack.mdc` |
| `apps/web/**/*.{tsx,css}`, `packages/ui/**/*.{tsx,css}` | `.cursor/rules/frontend/shadcnui.mdc` |
| `apps/web/**/*`, `packages/core/**/*`, `packages/react/**/*` | `.cursor/rules/frontend/auth.mdc` |
| web/api Playwright paths | `.cursor/rules/frontend/e2e-playwright.mdc` |
| `apps/api/**/*` | `.cursor/rules/backend/fastify.mdc` |
| `.agents/skills/**/*` | `.cursor/rules/cursor/skills.mdc` |
| `.cursor/rules/**/*.mdc` | `.cursor/rules/cursor/rules.mdc` |
| web3 / viem / wagmi / solana / cosmos / ponder | `.cursor/rules/web3/*.mdc` matching the stack |

## Product and docs

Public one-liner: **Coin Tracker — portfolio, markets, and on-chain data on Basilic.** Do not use swissknife or Vercel-identity copy. Agents participate through the product API, eve (command and chat), CLI, generated clients, and Generative UI. Canonical capability names live in `ARCHITECTURE.md` and on https://basilic-docs.vercel.app. `__dev/` is not public evidence.

Visual language is [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md). Technical adopter documentation lives on https://basilic-docs.vercel.app. Public README and root product markdown follow lock-installed `.agents/skills/technical-writing/` from [blockmatic/basilic-skills](https://github.com/blockmatic/basilic-skills); glob `.cursor/rules/base/docs.mdc` and `readme.mdc` override the skill when they conflict. Read `PRODUCT.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `README.md` before changing product behavior. Durable agents: command and chat in `apps/agents`. Do not create `ROADMAP.md`.

## Working contract

- The user's request defines the outcome and scope. For implementation requests, continue through the smallest complete change and appropriate verification; do not stop after proposing a plan. For review or diagnosis requests, remain read-only unless the user also asks for changes.
- Inspect before editing, preserve intentional decisions, reuse existing code and workspace packages, and solve the root cause with the smallest useful diff.
- Make routine, reversible assumptions when needed and state the assumptions that materially affect the result. Ask before deciding product scope, priorities, success metrics, go-to-market, trust-boundary or secret-handling changes, and destructive or difficult-to-reverse operations.
- Preserve unrelated and uncommitted user changes. Never discard work to obtain a clean tree.
- Use `pnpm` and existing Turbo or workspace scripts. Do not substitute another package manager or invent commands that are not present in package scripts.
- Never edit generated OpenAPI output, generated API clients, or generated migration SQL directly. Change the owning source and run the documented generator or migration workflow.
- Keep secrets out of output and committed files. Use the repository's example environment-file conventions and obvious placeholders.
- Do not commit, push, create or merge a pull request, deploy, publish, or mutate external systems unless the user requests that action. Never bypass hooks or force-push.

"Do not run a parallel process" means do not invent a parallel development methodology, rule tree, product brief, roadmap, or documentation hierarchy. Batching independent reads and checks is encouraged when it improves turnaround without creating conflicting edits or duplicate work.

## Validation and durable context

- Prove changes with the narrowest relevant checks first. Run affected tests, type checks, linting, generation checks, or broader `pnpm qa` in proportion to the change and the applicable workflow skill.
- Do not claim completion when required checks failed or were not run. Report the exact remaining failure or unverified behavior.
- When behavior, architecture, commands, or conventions change, update the matching MDX page and nearest README in the same work.
- Passing `pnpm qa` is local/CI evidence, not product success.
- When creating a plan, include a `## References` section listing the rules, skills, and documentation used.

Finish with a concise, outcome-first summary: what changed, where it changed, which checks passed, and any actionable blocker. Distinguish verified facts, reasonable inferences, assumptions, and unresolved questions.

## Harness extras

These are loaders and UX, not a second contract.

- **Cursor:** glob auto-attach for `.cursor/rules`; slash skills (Basilic `/w-plan` `/w-grill` `/w-wayfinder` `/w-*`); MCP in `.cursor/mcp.json`.
- **Claude Code:** reads this file. Project skills are `.agents/skills/` (not committed `.claude/skills/`).
- **Antigravity:** workspace rules in `.agents/rules/`; skills in `.agents/skills/`.
- **Gemini CLI:** reads this file. Skills share `.agents/skills/`.

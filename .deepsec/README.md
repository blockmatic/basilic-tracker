# deepsec

This directory holds the [deepsec](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deepsec) config for the parent repo. Checked into git so teammates inherit project context (auth shape, threat model, custom matchers); generated scan output is gitignored.

Currently configured project: `basilic` (target: `..`).

## Setup

`npx deepsec init` created this workspace and normally completes its install, exact Vercel project link, Sandbox/model probes, threat model, coverage-guided scans, custom matchers, and first AI processing run.

If setup was interrupted, run `pnpm deepsec setup` here or re-run the original init command. Checkpoints in `data/basilic/setup/setup-state.json` skip completed work. The linked Vercel project is always in Sandbox scope.

Use `--model-auth direct --ai-provider <provider> --ai-api-key-env <ENV_NAME>` to use a user-owned model credential; secret values remain in the environment or `.env.local`. Use `--model-auth local` to rely on a machine-wide `claude`/`codex` login instead — no API key or env vars needed.

From the monorepo root: `pnpm security:deepsec:scan`, `pnpm security:deepsec:process:diff` (Grok 4.6 / Pi), `pnpm security:deepsec:process:diff:sol` (GPT-5.6 Sol / Codex), `pnpm security:deepsec:process`, `pnpm security:deepsec:report`. CI uses Grok 4.6 on same-repo PRs from OWNER, MEMBER, or COLLABORATOR when `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` is set and the PR changes at most 80 files (`.github/workflows/deepsec.yml`). Not in pre-commit or `security.yml`.

pnpm 12 rejects lockfile entries younger than 24 hours (`minimumReleaseAge`). Security patches published inside that window go in `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (currently `qs@6.16.0` for CVE-2026-82417 / CVE-2026-82562). Install scripts must be listed under `allowBuilds` (`true` to run, `false` to skip).

## Daily commands

```bash
pnpm deepsec scan
pnpm deepsec process     --concurrency 5
pnpm deepsec revalidate  --concurrency 5                  # cuts FP rate
pnpm deepsec export      --format md-dir --out ./findings
```

`--project-id` is auto-resolved while there's only one project in `deepsec.config.ts`. Once you've added a second project, pass `--project-id basilic` (or whichever id you want) explicitly.

`scan` is free (regex only). `process` is the AI stage (`pi` / `xai/grok-4.6` by default). Run state goes to `data/tracker/`.

## Adding another project

To scan another codebase from this same `.deepsec/`:

```bash
pnpm deepsec init-project ../some-other-package   # path relative to .deepsec/
```

Appends an entry to `deepsec.config.ts` and writes `data/<id>/{INFO.md,SETUP.md,project.json}`. Open the new SETUP.md in your agent to fill in INFO.md.

## Layout
